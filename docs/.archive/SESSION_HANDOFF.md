# üêù The Hive Development Session - HANDOFF STATUS

## üéØ Current Status: `/sc:git-mcp` Command Integration

**Issue**: User restarted Claude Code CLI but `/sc:git-mcp` command still not visible as slash command.

**Root Cause**: SuperClaude slash commands work differently than expected. The integration into COMMANDS.md may not be sufficient to make it an active slash command in Claude Code sessions.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. Complete Hive Distribution System
- ‚úÖ Universal installer (install.sh) with cross-platform support
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific installers (macOS, Linux, Windows)  
- ‚úÖ 6 enhancement scripts fully implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing framework
- ‚úÖ Professional documentation and GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ Repository deployed: https://github.com/KHAEntertainment/the-hive

### 2. Git-MCP Integration Work
- ‚úÖ Created standalone sc-git-mcp.sh script (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Added command definition to SuperClaude COMMANDS.md
- ‚úÖ Created implementation documentation
- ‚úÖ Updated all public documentation to show slash command usage

### 3. MCP Servers Installed
- ‚úÖ git-mcp: Enhanced Git operations
- ‚úÖ react-docs: Facebook React repository (test installation)
- ‚ùå Removed kilocode-docs and gemini-cli-docs from public distribution

## üö® Current Problem

The `/sc:git-mcp` command is not appearing as an available slash command in Claude Code sessions despite:
1. Being added to SuperClaude COMMANDS.md
2. Having complete implementation documentation
3. Documentation being updated

**Likely Issue**: SuperClaude slash commands may require:
- Additional integration steps beyond COMMANDS.md
- Registration in a different system/file
- Claude Code CLI restart may not be sufficient
- Command handler implementation in actual SuperClaude framework code

## üìã Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Debug SuperClaude Integration
1. **Research actual SuperClaude command system**
   - Find how existing `/sc:` commands are implemented
   - Locate command handlers and registration system
   - Understand the difference between documentation and active commands

2. **Proper Implementation**
   - Implement actual command handler (not just documentation)
   - Register command in correct SuperClaude system files
   - Test integration thoroughly

### Option 2: Alternative Approaches
1. **Direct Script Integration**
   - Make sc-git-mcp.sh easily accessible as `the-hive git-mcp`
   - Add to Hive CLI commands instead of SuperClaude
   - Update documentation to reflect direct usage

2. **Alias/Wrapper Approach**
   - Create shell alias for `/sc:git-mcp` ‚Üí script execution
   - Add to user's shell configuration during Hive installation

## üîß Files Modified This Session

### SuperClaude Configuration
- `/Users/bbrenner/.claude/COMMANDS.md` - Added command definition
- `/Users/bbrenner/.claude/SC_GIT_MCP_COMMAND.md` - Command specification
- `/Users/bbrenner/.claude/SC_GIT_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guide

### The Hive Documentation
- `the-hive/docs/installation-guide.md` - Updated with slash command usage
- `the-hive/README.md` - Added Git-MCP integration section
- `the-hive/enhancements/scripts/sc-git-mcp.sh` - Original working script

### Working Script Location
- **Fully Functional**: `/Users/bbrenner/Documents/Scripting Projects/thehive/scripts/the-hive/enhancements/scripts/sc-git-mcp.sh`
- **Test Verified**: Successfully installed react-docs MCP server
- **Features**: Interactive mode, URL conversion, help system

## üß™ Testing Status

**Standalone Script**: ‚úÖ WORKING
```bash
./enhancements/scripts/sc-git-mcp.sh facebook/react
# Successfully installs react-docs MCP server
```

**Slash Command**: ‚ùå NOT VISIBLE
```
/sc:git-mcp
# Command not recognized in Claude Code session
```

## üí° Recommended Immediate Action

1. **Investigate SuperClaude command system architecture**
2. **Find existing `/sc:` command implementations**
3. **Determine proper integration method**
4. **Test slash command functionality**
5. **Update GitHub repository once working**

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] `/sc:git-mcp` appears as available slash command
- [ ] Command executes properly with all functionality
- [ ] Interactive mode works
- [ ] Help system displays correctly
- [ ] MCP servers install successfully via slash command

## üìù Context for Next Session

**User Goal**: Make `/sc:git-mcp` work as proper SuperClaude slash command
**Current Blocker**: Command not recognized despite documentation integration
**Working Alternative**: Standalone script is fully functional
**Repository Ready**: https://github.com/KHAEntertainment/the-hive (don't push until slash command works)

**Key Question**: How do SuperClaude slash commands actually get registered and executed in Claude Code sessions?
