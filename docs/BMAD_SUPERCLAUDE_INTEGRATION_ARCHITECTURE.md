/sc:build web-app
/sc:implement user-authentication

# Enhanced with BMAD methodology via flags
/sc:build web-app --bmad-validate --methodology-compliance
/sc:implement user-authentication --bmad-guided --best-practices

# Auto-activation for complex projects
/sc:analyze large-system  # Auto-activates BMAD for complexity > 0.8
```

#### Flag-Based Enhancement
- `--bmad-guided`: Enable step-by-step BMAD methodology guidance
- `--bmad-validate`: Add BMAD compliance validation to any command
- `--methodology-check`: Real-time best practice validation
- `--bmad-document`: Auto-generate BMAD-compliant documentation
